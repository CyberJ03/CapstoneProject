<h1>Cybersecurity Bootcamp Capstone</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I worked with Peter Song, Will Schmidt, and Rebecca Davis who by the way are all great up-and-coming cybersecurity professionals. For our capstone project, we created Bigfoot Consulting and were hired by a fictitious company Patterson Gimlin. Our consulting firm was hired to perform social engineering attacks to promote awareness and test Patterson Gimlin's vulnerability to such attacks. In the video below you will see the presentation that Bigfoot Consulting created detailing the various attacks deployed, how they were deployed, and the success of each individual attack. This presentation was presented onsite at Patterson Gimlin's headquarters at the end of the quarter all-hands meeting. Enjoy!!
